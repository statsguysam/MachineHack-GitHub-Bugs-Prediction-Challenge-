# Steps to run the code

First run MH_Multiclass_85022.ipynb, MH_Multiclass_84944.ipynb and MH_Multiclass_849.ipynb in any order

Three different csv files would be generated which are roberta_base_1epochunfreeze_1epochfreeze_3_lr2e5.csv, roberta_base_1epochunfreeze_2epochsfreeze_3_lr2e5.csv and  roberta_base_1epochunfreeze_3epochsfreeze_lr2e5.csv

These three files go as an input to ensemble.py which will throw the final output as a csv file (final_submission.csv)
